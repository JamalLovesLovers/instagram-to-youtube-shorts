# instagram-to-youtube-shorts
This Project allows you to use an extension that displays a button whilst you watch Instagram reels. Then you can press a button and it automatically uploads the reel to YoutubeShorts with no interruptions. 


# How to run:

* Download the project in your preffered manner
* Head into upload_youtube.js and upload_youtube.py and insert your YoutubeV3Api Keys. You can ask ChatGPT to help you with this. 
* Go to a chromium browser, locate the extentions and manage extentions button. Turn on developer more and press load unpacked and select the folder named extention-portion.
* Open the proejct in a code editor, VsCode reccomended
* Open the terminal and run npm i, you should see a node modules folder
* Open the terminal and run ``` python app.py ```
* Go to an instagram reels url, ensure the url bar says reels and not reel. If it doesn't you can replace it yourself.
* Search for the Download reel button, you may need to scroll a few times &/ refresh the page
* Press the download button on your desired reel.
* Head over to the terminal and you should see information about the uploading process,

* If you face errors, you can ask GPT, alternatively add an issue in the issues tab


# Limitations

* Only around 5-10 videos per day for free
* Youtube seems to have a thing against reuploaded content, I haven't seen any viral videos through this method, although it is very low effort.
* If anyone wants to add a reupload to Tiktok or Insta reels button, it would likely show more success
